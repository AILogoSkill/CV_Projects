This repository contains code and data for two computer vision tasks: face recognition and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

## Face Recognition

- Dataset: We generated a dataset of Hollywood actors using the Bing Image Downloader.
- Techniques: Face recognition is performed using cosine similarity metrics.
- Description: Our face recognition model can identify and compare Hollywood actors' faces.

## Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

- Dataset: We used the Flicker 8k dataset.
- Techniques: Neural network algorithms were employed to generate color images from black and white datasets.
- Description: Our GAN successfully generates RGB datasets from black and white images without introducing noise.
